# PigGame (Dice Game)

 Pig Dice Game was first described in print in 1945 by John Scarne and this is my interpretation of it using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

 ## Play Requirements

 Any mordern browser - Chrome, Firefox, etc.

 ## Installation

 Any code editor - VSCode, Sublime, etc. I have used VSCode.

 ## Game Rules.

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
