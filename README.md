# PigGame (Dice Game)

 Pig Dice Game was first described in print in 1945 by John Scarne and this is my interpretation of it using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

 ## Play Requirements

 Any mordern browser - Chrome, Firefox, etc.

 ## Installation

 Any code editor - VSCode, Sublime, etc. I have used VSCode.

 ## Game Rules.

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- Custom rules:
    1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he/she rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. (Commented)
    2. Input field where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefiend score of 100. (Live)
    3. Another dice to mix things up. (Live) 

Custom rules 1 and 3 do not work together (you can contribute if you want all 3), so make sure either one is running else the code will not run as expected. Final build has custom rules 2 and 3 deployed. Hope you enjoy the game!
